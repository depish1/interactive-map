## About

!! Work in progress

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! **Interactive map** is a web application for reading data about countries of the world from an external api. The application has an interactive map from which we can choose the countries we want to learn about. After a few clicks, they will be added to the list in the side panel where you can read the downloaded data about them.
For optimization, I used the Context API for data storage with the implemented publish-subscribe pattern in order to limit the number of rerenders.
